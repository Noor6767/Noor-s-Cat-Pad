Custim and DIY Keyboard!
#Description
After having a boring ahh keyboard that came with my computer, I needed a new one. I was thinking of buying a keyboard(the one that has led's and looks good) but then I thought that like "Oh. Hackclub exists." so I made one... So since it is very customizable i added a rotary encoder and 104 keys. Is it a bit much? yes. But who cares because I made it anyway. I also made this keyboard hot-swappable, so that I can easily swap switches (mx and kalih) i wanted to switche between clicky and like soft but slightly clicky switches whenever i wanted to.
