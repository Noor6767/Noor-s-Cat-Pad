# Noor-s-Cat-Pad

## Day 1 - July 23 4:00 pm
I really wanted to do this ever since i was doing my Hackpad but it got delayed since i procasinated it so im just gonna grind. 
In my final desing i want
- a rotary encoder
- RGB lights
- a kickstand to increase the height. i dont want it built in because i want to have it adgustable so ill just 3-d print some with different heights.

The plan is to grind since i only have 9 days and I only have the knowledge and experience of the Hackpad. So i plan to add the 104 keys in a grid and then connect them into the pico.
 -so this was very confusing since i didnt know where to even put the swites and diodes on the grid. i did mess up like 2 time so that was extreamly time consuming. i did the first column and then copied it in rows of 10 and 11 colums and deleted the ones i didnt need. i also added a rotary encoder since why not. So this shouldnt have taken me 30 min. It was becuase i didn't know that i had to add a diode and where so i got some help from a friend and he helped a lot.

## Day 2 - July 24 2:00 pm 
so today i'll do the led's. i wanted to have an led in every key so i added 104 leds... i did not know how to do this since it is my first time (very great time to make a BIG ahh keyboard and LED'S WHICH IDK HOW TO DO) So i requested guilded my friend to help and i added them in snake so yea. i did learn a lot from this because i didnt do it in the Hackpad.

## Day 3 - July 27 1 pm
Ngl after finishing the schematic I was kinda burned out cuz i had other work too and needed a break. I also went to the beach üòäüòäüèñÔ∏è I was also informied that this ends on july 31 AND NO ONE TOLD ME. So now i acc have to grind. So now i have to place all the keys and I made a huge mistake. so apparently i am supposed to put it like how i have it on my schematics (which makes sence) and i had to redo it all that took ALL DAY and imm still not done :( . so I went on Keyboard Layout Editor and went on the one i wanted and so i had to get it PERFECT and my computer was tweaking so that was also great. but after 30 min i got the hang of it and it all made sence. 

## Day 4 - July 28 - 10 am
So im just gonna work all day with 3 potty breaks. so i finnished placing all of them and now went to place all the diodes and the LED's. So when i tell you i really hate doing this(not rlly i love it) because WHY DID I HAVE TO REDO LIKE 3 TIMES. üò°üò° to explain the hatred (jk it love in another form ‚ù§Ô∏èüíòüíò) So i was placing the diodes with the LED's which was the most confusing thing. like idk why i did it. so i woould get for example Diode1 and the LED1 and put them on SW1 and do that on like everyone so the all the numbers would be the same. (idk why i thought that) i relized when i got to the space bar that i would need more leds here. So i then consulted my friend and he said to to do it in snake method. so i then i was doing it like 
L1 L2 L3 
L4 L5 L6   instead of doing the snake rule so then i changed it again so then i won't have a problem doing the wiring. 

## Day 5 - July 29 8 am
So i have 660 wires to wire which is very nice because i have 2 days (i wanna get it finished by 31) So im just gonna grind. there acc isnt much to talk about i just sat and clicked for hours. So i added the ground pour first so ill be happy when the number goes down (giving myself hope:) ) i finsihed a lot acc. i did everything except the +5V and GND and the rasberry pi and now i have like 290 wires left.  

## Day 5 - July 29 1 pm
Im gonna to the rest of the wiring. So the wiring was also very easy it was just that i have no room and had to make a very un organized place but its fine because who is looking (lmao u guys are looking hah)
